# tobe4home Architecture

## Overview

The tobe4home is a modular Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) project based on
Ansible. It automates the deployment and lifecycle management of self-hosted
services running on Proxmox VE using Debian LXC containers.

The architecture separates infrastructure, automation, services and
documentation into reusable components.

## Design Principles

- Infrastructure as Code
- Reproducible deployments
- Modular Ansible roles
- Idempotent playbooks
- Documentation first
- Security by default
