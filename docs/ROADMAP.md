# tobe4home Roadmap

This document describes the planned evolution of the tobe4home.

The roadmap reflects current priorities and may change as the project evolves.

---

# Vision

Provide a reproducible, fully documented and modular Infrastructure-as-Code
platform for self-hosted services running on Proxmox VE.

The platform should allow a complete environment to be rebuilt from scratch
using Ansible.

---

# Released milestones

## v0.5.1

Documentation and Open WebUI stabilization.

Delivered:

- Documentation cleanup
- Open WebUI improvements
- LDAP refinements
- Validation improvements
- Operational stability

## v0.6.0 - Mail Backend Foundation

Released 2026-08-29:

- Debian 13 `bergen-mail` LXC deployment
- Postfix/Dovecot with LDAP-backed identities
- Mailuser-only create-only mailbox provisioning
- authenticated submission, LMTP and IMAPS
- equivalent identity domains, aliases and Send-as ownership
- private smart-host integration with IPv4 preference

## v0.7.0 - Platform Services and Daytrading

Released 2026-09-13:

- Provider-neutral daytrading collector with Alpaca, IBKR and replay adapters
- Automated daytrading LXC deployment and site-local inventory maintenance
- Vault-backed provider and SMTP credentials

# Beyond v1.0

## Mail Platform

Implemented foundation:

- Scoped public-gateway TLS/Certbot lifecycle checkpoint (2026-10-11):
  RSA/ECDSA gateway certificates, DNS-01 wildcard, exact-name MTA-STS
  certificate with IPv4/IPv6 HTTPS, renewal-hook tests and successful global
  no-op timer run; see [Mail TLS operations](MAIL-TLS-OPERATIONS.md).
  The next real unattended renewal and full consumer sync still need evidence.
- Internal Postfix submission and delivery backend
- Dovecot LDAP authentication, LMTP and IMAPS
- Mailuser-only create-only mailbox provisioning
- Declarative aliases and Send-as ownership
- Relay integration with an existing public gateway

Planned:

- monitor actual unattended TLS renewal, lineage-scoped service reloads,
  controller-to-backend certificate synchronization and certificate expiry;
  complete remaining backend/client TLS acceptance
- firewall and private gateway-path enforcement
- end-to-end gateway queueing and delivery acceptance tests
- SMTP AUTH, IMAP, mailbox and alias authorization test matrix
- mail migration with bulk and final incremental synchronization
- mailbox backup and isolated restore validation
- RFC 5322 From-header ownership policy/Milter
- external client access design and Fail2ban/rate limiting
- queue, authentication, disk, certificate and timer monitoring
- Webmail evaluation

The existing public gateway remains responsible for Rspamd/spam policy, DKIM,
DMARC-related delivery policy, public reputation, MTA-STS and TLS reporting.
These functions are not duplicated in the internal backend unless the gateway
architecture changes.

## Additional Services

Future candidates:

- Nextcloud
- Matrix
- Asterisk
- High Availability
- Multi-node deployments
- CI/CD
- Automated testing

# Guided bootstrap and AI-assisted self-installation (prototype)

- Stage 0: reviewed Proxmox shell bootstrap, isolated RHEL-compatible setup LXC,
  localhost-only web wizard, no production writes from the wizard.
- Stage 1: independent offline recovery copy, Ansible controller, inventory,
  encrypted site secrets and independent backups with successful restore test.
- Stage 2: internally hosted Forgejo LTS, protected branches and isolated CI.
- Stage 3: central identity, TLS, least-privilege user delegation and security tests.
- Stage 4: local coding LLM, sandboxed coding agents, explicit approval gateway.
- Stage 5: Langflow/MCP as optional GUI-based orchestration, service blueprints.
- Stage 6: idempotent staged deployments with lifecycle, rollback and recovery.

Policy: no unsupported LTS releases, prefer RHEL-compatible guests,
Podman/Quadlet over Docker, and keep Git/Ansible as the deterministic authority.
See [BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md) for the actual stage-0 limitations.
