# Automated distribution of a renewed mail wildcard certificate

The controller utility reuses the Git-ignored local YAML from the read-only
preflight. No actual hostnames, DNS zones, Certbot lineages, credentials or key
material are committed. This utility distributes renewed certificates only:
it does not renew Let's Encrypt certificates itself.

## Preconditions

The controller requires its Python virtual environment with PyYAML and ssh.
Both SSH peer host keys must already be independently verified and pinned.
A private SSH control socket is created in a per-run mode-0700 temporary
folder; the script reuses the authenticated transport for successive probes
rather than opening seven new TCP connections to the source. On completion,
the master connections are explicitly asked to exit and the temporary
socket directory is removed.
The source user requires noninteractive sudo -n privileges to read the Certbot
certificate/key and inspect them with OpenSSL. The target requires verified
noninteractive root SSH access. Restrict sudo rules on the source, never
disable host-key verification and never enable agent forwarding.

The installed mail certificate and key must already form a valid pair. Missing
or mismatched live files require manual repair before automatic deployment.

The real ignored YAML, ansible/vars/mail-tls.local.yml, must be mode 0600.
It uses the same variables as the existing Ansible preflight. Optional YAML
entries are:

    mail_tls_target_ssh_address: CHANGE_ME_SSH_ALIAS
    mail_tls_target_ssh_user: root
    mail_tls_check_ports: [993, 587, 465]

The target SSH address defaults to mail_tls_target_inventory_host and its
SSH user defaults to root. Only include ports that actually run on the target.

## First run: no changes

From the repository root on the controller:

    chmod 600 ansible/vars/mail-tls.local.yml
    python3 -m pytest -q tests/test_mail_tls_sync.py
    bash -n scripts/mail_tls_remote_activate.sh

    .venv/bin/python3 scripts/mail_tls_sync.py \
      --config ansible/vars/mail-tls.local.yml

The first invocation is read-only. If the source and target already have
identical certificate fingerprints, it verifies the actual TLS listeners and
reports NO_CHANGE without copying any file or restarting any service. When
the source differs, the program reports ROTATE but does not change anything.
After manual review, an explicit production rotation is:

    .venv/bin/python3 scripts/mail_tls_sync.py \
      --config ansible/vars/mail-tls.local.yml --apply

The source check requires an unexpired certificate with at least 30 days
validity left, matching wildcard SAN, expected hostname, and matching
certificate/key public keys. The target checks the effective Postfix/Dovecot
TLS settings and the installed certificate/key pairing. A certificate
downgrade to an earlier expiry is rejected.

For a real rotation, both files travel over verified SSH as an encrypted
pipe; no private-key file is created on the controller. The target validates
the staged certificate, private key, CA chain and destination permissions.
Before changing live files it creates a restricted rollback copy. Postfix
and Dovecot are stopped briefly, the new pair activated and checked over
the configured TLS service ports. Detected activation errors trigger a
best-effort rollback. Abrupt power loss or SIGKILL cannot be rolled back.

Staging is removed after the attempt if reachable. Rollback copies are
deliberately retained and require separately reviewed cleanup.

## Opt-in systemd user timer

Install the unit examples locally on the controller only after a successful
read-only run and confirmation that both SSH access paths are noninteractive.

    mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
    cp systemd/user/mail-tls-sync.service.example \
       ~/.config/systemd/user/mail-tls-sync.service
    cp systemd/user/mail-tls-sync.timer.example \
       ~/.config/systemd/user/mail-tls-sync.timer
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    systemctl --user start mail-tls-sync.service
    systemctl --user status mail-tls-sync.service
    systemctl --user enable --now mail-tls-sync.timer
    systemctl --user list-timers mail-tls-sync.timer

The sample unit expects the repository at %h/bergen-platform and the venv
inside it. Adapt only the untracked installed systemd unit if needed. A
persistent user timer after logout may require enabling systemd lingering
for the controller account.

The timer checks daily around 04:15, with up to 30 minutes randomized delay.
Failures produce a nonzero unit result and a journal message. Inspect via:

    journalctl --user -u mail-tls-sync.service --since '7 days ago'
    systemctl --user --failed

Failed units are NOT automatically notifications. Connect failures to the
existing syslog/monitoring system if alert delivery is required.

Separately ensure that source Certbot DNS-01 certificate renewal can run
without manual intervention, or renew the source before the 30-day threshold.
