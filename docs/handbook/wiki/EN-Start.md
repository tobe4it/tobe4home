You do not need to be a Linux expert to use the platform or prepare a handover. This handbook explains each system's role, its dependencies and the point at which a trained caretaker should take over.

## Three reading paths

- **Outage or estate handover:** Start with emergency help, find the private contact and recovery route, and preserve existing data.
- **Everyday use:** Read the application sections, use authorized personal accounts, and describe failures accurately.
- **New caretaker:** Study fundamentals, automation and recovery; inventory the actual deployment and prove isolated restoration.

## Public guide and private operating record

This edition describes available architecture and verifiable procedures. It contains no real deployment addresses, private domain names or credentials. Documentation examples use `example.test` and `192.0.2.0/24`.

An implemented role, a successful Ansible recap and an accepted user function are different evidence. Distinguish planned, prepared and productive components. Prove a backup through an actual successful restore.

The separate blank printout is for the small number of necessary secrets unavailable from vaults or a password manager. Print it, enter those values by hand offline and store it securely. Reference secrets already managed elsewhere rather than duplicating them.
